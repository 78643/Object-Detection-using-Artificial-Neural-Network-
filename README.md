# Object-Detection-using-Artificial-Neural-Network
This project demonstrates Object Detection using a trained deep learning model. The system detects and localizes objects within images or video streams, drawing bounding boxes and labeling them with class names.

Welcome to my Object Detection project! This ML-based project is focused on detecting and locating objects within images using advanced computer vision techniques. The goal is to enable machines to “see” and understand images, assisting in automation, surveillance, and AI-powered applications.

## **🚀 Objective**


Detect and classify multiple objects in images with their bounding boxes using deep learning models.


**🧪 Models Applied**

I applied and evaluated the following object detection algorithms:

📦 YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once – v5) ✅ Best Accuracy

📦 Faster R-CNN

📦 SSD (Single Shot Detector)

📦 RetinaNet


**🔍 Key Results**

Model	mAP (Mean Average Precision)	Speed (FPS)

YOLOv5	✅ 92%	~45 FPS

Faster R-CNN	~89%	~12 FPS

SSD	~85%	~25 FPS

RetinaNet	~87%	~20 FPS


**🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used**

🐍 Python 3

🖼️ OpenCV – Image processing

📦 PyTorch / TensorFlow – Deep learning framework

📉 Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

⚙️ YOLOv5 / Detectron2 – Object detection models

🧪 Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development

💾 Weights & Biases – Model tracking (optional)


**📂 Dataset**

Name: COCO Dataset / Custom Dataset

📥 Download: COCO Dataset or your own annotated dataset

📝 Annotation Format: YOLO TXT / Pascal VOC XML


**📸 Visualizations**

The project includes the following visual insights:

📦 Bounding boxes drawn around detected objects

📊 Class distribution charts
